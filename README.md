# EPL 1993to2020

My first sports data analytics project. 

EPL stats from 1993 to 2018: https://www.kaggle.com/thefc17/epl-results-19932018
EPL stats for 2019 and 2020: http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php (You can find all EPL years)

Some of the questions I will attempt to answer:
1- H2H results of the big 6 since 1993
2- Relation between winning at half-time & full-time
3- Home teams half-time results vs Away teams half-time results
4- Outcome if games were 45minutes long (1rst Half vs 2nd Half)
